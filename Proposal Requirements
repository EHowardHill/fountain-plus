Proposal due Wednesday 1/30 (Not sure when presentation is due (or when powerpoint file is due either)
Ten or so slides by the look of it:

    - a general description of the project
    
    - describe the intended users of the project.  How will this project make their life better?
    
    - screenshot of the user interface(s).  Make this as production-ready as possible.
    
    - a list of constraints, if any, such as OS, language, and target device
    
    - describe an existing product that is close to, but not the same as, your product
